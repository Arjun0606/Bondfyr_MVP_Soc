# App Store Review Response

**Submission ID:** 2e1fa0c8-80ca-4589-9fc0-b9336b1536c2
**Response Date:** August 19, 2025
**App:** Bondfyr v1.0

## Response to Guideline 4.8 - Design - Login Services

Thank you for your feedback regarding login services. We have successfully implemented **Sign in with Apple** as an equivalent login option alongside Google Sign-In. 

### Changes Made:
- ✅ **Added Sign in with Apple button** on the main login screen
- ✅ **Sign in with Apple implementation** meets all requirements specified in guideline 4.8:
  - Limits data collection to user's name and email address only
  - Allows users to keep their email address private (Apple's "Hide My Email" feature)
  - Does not collect interactions with the app for advertising purposes without consent
- ✅ **Maintained Google Sign-In** as an alternative option for user choice

Both login options are prominently displayed with equal visual treatment on our login screen.
