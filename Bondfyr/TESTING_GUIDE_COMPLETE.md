## üß™ **How to Test Everything Works**

### **Test 1: Notification System**
```
1. Open app ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí "Test Notifications"
2. Should receive 4 test notifications over 8 seconds
3. Check console logs for detailed status
4. If no notifications: Settings ‚Üí "Check Notification Status"
```

### **Test 2: Party Request Flow (2 Devices Required)**

**Device A (Host):**
```
1. Create a new party with $20 ticket price
2. Wait for party to appear in feed
3. Leave app open to receive notifications
```

**Device B (Guest):**
```
1. Find the party in nearby feed
2. Tap "Request to Join ($20)" - should show contact sheet
3. Send join request with intro message
4. Wait for approval notification
```

**Device A (Host):**
```
1. Should receive "New Guest Request" notification
2. Open app ‚Üí Tap party ‚Üí "Manage Guests"
3. See pending request with Approve/Deny buttons
4. Tap "Approve" 
5. Guest should be in "Approved" section (not yet in activeUsers)
```

**Device B (Guest):**
```
1. Should receive "Request Approved!" notification
2. Open app ‚Üí Find party ‚Üí Button now shows "Complete Payment ($20)"
3. Tap payment button ‚Üí Dodo payment sheet opens
4. Complete payment in browser/webview
5. Should receive "You're In!" confirmation
6. Button should now show "Going" (green)
```

**Device A (Host):**
```
1. Should receive "Payment Received $16.00" notification (80% of $20)
2. Guest should now appear in party chat as active member
3. Guest count should increment by 1
```

### **Test 3: Payment Button States**

Check that buttons show correct states:
- **Not Requested**: "Request to Join ($X)"
- **Pending**: "Pending" (disabled)
- **Approved**: "Complete Payment ($X)" (blue, clickable)
- **Going**: "Going" (green, disabled)
- **Denied**: "Request Denied" (gray)
- **Sold Out**: "Sold Out" (gray)

### **Test 4: Notification Permissions**

**When Notifications Enabled:**
```
1. Should receive all notifications normally
2. Console logs show "üü¢ Notifications authorized"
```

**When Notifications Disabled:**
```
1. Go to iOS Settings ‚Üí Bondfyr ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí OFF
2. Test flow again - should work without errors
3. Console logs show "üî¥ Notifications denied - using fallbacks"
4. Critical events logged for analytics
```

### **Test 5: Commission Calculation**

```
Party Price: $20
Host Receives: $16 (80%)
Platform Fee: $4 (20%)

Notification should say: "Guest paid $16.00 for Party Name"
```

### **Test 6: Edge Cases**

**Capacity Limits:**
```
1. Create party with maxGuestCount = 2
2. Approve 2 guests
3. Host should get "Party at 80% capacity" alert
```

**Multiple Requests:**
```
1. Send multiple requests from different accounts
2. Each should appear in pending list
3. Approve/deny should work independently
```

**Party Chat Access:**
```
1. Only confirmed guests (in activeUsers) can post
2. Others can view but see "VIEW" indicator
3. Host can always post
```

## üîß **Debugging Tools**

### **Console Logging**
Enable detailed logging to track the flow:
```
üîî NOTIFICATION: [notification events]
üü¢ BACKEND: [database operations] 
üîç UI: [button states and user status]
üü¢ PAYMENT: [payment processing]
```

### **Settings Debug Options**
- **Test Notifications**: Verify notification system
- **Check Notification Status**: Troubleshoot permissions
- **Console output**: Detailed diagnostic information

### **Real-time Data Sync**
- Party data updates automatically across devices
- Guest status changes reflect immediately
- activeUsers array keeps everyone in sync

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations**

1. **TestFlight Mode**: Some flows may show "TestFlight Version" messaging
2. **Dodo Sandbox**: Payments use sandbox environment for testing
3. **iOS Simulator**: Push notifications don't work in simulator (use device)
4. **Network Required**: Real-time features need internet connection

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

‚úÖ **All features working if:**
- Guest can request to join party
- Host receives notification immediately  
- Host can approve guest request
- Guest receives approval notification
- Guest can complete payment via Dodo
- Host receives payment notification with correct amount
- Guest appears in party chat with post permissions
- All state changes sync across devices
- Notifications work (or fail gracefully)

## üöÄ **What's Now Production Ready**

1. **Complete notification system** with testing and fallbacks
2. **Proper payment flow** - guests pay AFTER approval
3. **Real-time party management** with accurate state tracking
4. **Commission structure** - 20% platform fee integrated
5. **Comprehensive error handling** for edge cases
6. **Multi-device synchronization** for live party updates
